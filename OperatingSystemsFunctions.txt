Starting Up a Computer

When you tell your computer to turn on, with a button or with some other method, the power supply (or internal battery) sends a zing of electricity to the processor chip, which resets itself from whatever its previous state was and forces it to look for its boot-up firmware.
The system does a self-inventory and makes sure that everything is working correctly. If there's a problem, the system informs the user. 
If everything's good to go, the core of the operating system (the "kernel") loads onto the RAM, where it will remain the whole time the device is running.
The operating system starts running things and loading system configuration information, and finally loads the UI and any start-up applications.
